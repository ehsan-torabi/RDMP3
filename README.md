# Music File Duplicate Remover

This Python script helps you find and remove duplicate music files in your directories.

## Description

The script works by traversing the directories you specify, identifying all music files (currently only .mp3 files are supported), and checking for duplicates. Duplicates are identified by their SHA-256 hash. If duplicates are found, you will be prompted to confirm their deletion.

## Usage

To use this script, simply run it from the command line with the directories you want to check as arguments. For example:

```bash
python3 duplicate_remover.py /path/to/directory1 /path/to/directory2
```

If no directories are specified, the script will check the current directory.

## Functions

- `is_music(file)`: Checks if a file is a music file.
- `get_all_music_files(paths)`: Gets all music files in the given paths.
- `get_files_state(paths)`: Gets the state of the files in the given paths.
- `delete_duplicates(files_state)`: Deletes duplicate files.
